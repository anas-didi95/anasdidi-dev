**SOLID** is a set of five design principles used in object-oriented programming to make software easier to understand, flexible and maintain.

Robert C. Martin introduced the theory of SOLID in year 2000 on his paper *Design Principles and Design Patterns*. Later, Micheal Feathers introduced the SOLID acronym.

SOLID stands for
- **S**ingle-responsibility Principle
- **O**pen-closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

Following writing will discussed on one of the principles which is **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**.
