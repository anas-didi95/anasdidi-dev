**Git** is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in files. It is mostly used by developers to track changes in source code in software development.

Git has remote repository which stored in a server and local repository which stored in the computer. Rather than have only single source of truth for full history of files, Git allows every developer's workspace to have a copy of the history.

Thus, having a distributed version-control system provides speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows for developers. Multiple developers can work in parallel using their local repository and share the latest changes to others by commit to remote repository. 


Following are the list of common Git commands and usages to get started.
