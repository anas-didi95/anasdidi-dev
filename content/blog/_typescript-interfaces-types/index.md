TypeScript is an open-source language which acts as superset of JavaScript, with additional of static typing to the language.

By having static typing to the language, it providing better documentation and enable type-checking at compile time when transcompiles to JavaScript.

One of TypeScript's principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. Thus, TypeScript has [Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) to fill the role of naming these types.

TypeScript also has several basic types such as string, boolean and number which can be referred [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#table-of-contents). However, if we want to create a new or advanced types, TypeScript has [Type Aliases](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-aliases) for that purpose.

Sometimes, **Type Aliases** is similar to **Interfaces**. However, both have different purposes and use-cases when using TypeScript.
